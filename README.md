# Ingeniux Authoring Toolbar
This project was started at the end of 2020 to solve the issue of disconnect between content authors and content publishers. Authors often feel most comfortable in the familliar word proccessing environment of Microsoft Word. Instead of forcing content creators to adapt to the CMS, the CMS should adapt to the preferred environment of the author. 

This add in is designed to seamlessly pull in schema and content data from a customer's CMS, allowing for the creation of dynamic content templates allowing user to author the content in Word.
